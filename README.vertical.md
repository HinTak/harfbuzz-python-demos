# Vertical layout examples

Unlike `c++ hb-view`, `hb-view.py` defaults to vertical for CJK, and also the two Mongolian scripts.

Here are three examples:

![mongolian](images/mongolian-example1.png) ![japanese](images/japanese-example.png) ![phags pa](images/phagspa-example2.png)

The below is from `c++ hb-view`. Note that the small kana is aligned differently in vertical layout; and of course, the rotated
quotation marks:

Here is a break-down of the individual letters in the Phags Pa example:
